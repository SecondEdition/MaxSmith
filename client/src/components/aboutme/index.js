        <h1>Hello, my name is Max</h1>
        <p>
        I grew up in Pagosa Springs, Southwest Colorado. I graduated from CU 
        Boulder with degrees in English Literature and History in 2011 and have
        worked in Boulder since, helping to build and sell custom travel to 
        Asia and designing and maintaining small business IT systems.<br />
        <br />
        My loves are my family, nature, and great stories. <br />
        <br />
        My purpose is to work and to learn. I am fascinated by technology and the ways in 
        which it enhances and augments our ability to interact and engage with the world. 
        I especially enjoy designing solutions to problems of all sizes 
        that are both elegant and efficient.<br />
        <br />
        When I'm not working or learning or perfecting my craft, I am gaining inspiration
        via a litany of outdoor activities, or by reading or watching movies. My favorite 
        media genres are science and historical fiction. I also enjoy strategy games or rpgs
        with well-crafted narratives.<br />
        <br />
        I work hard and strive to lift up and support those around me. I have good
        business sense, communicate well, and enjoy solving difficult problems. I am responsible and 
        reliable. <br />
        <br />
